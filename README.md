# Aliens
I have done the program using java language. In my program I have three class file.
1. Aliens.java - It is the main java file so to run the program one has to run this file.
2. exportFile.java- It contains the interface. 
3. pdf.java-  This file contains the code to export the data in pdf file and implements the exportFile interface.
		in this code i used itext api for creating pdf so to run this file you have to add "itextpdf-5.5.6.jar" to library.
4. text.java- This file contains the code to export the data in text file and implements the exportFile interface. 

How to run the program:
To run the program run Aliens.java file. It will ask to enter the details about the alien.
then it will ask whether you want to add another details.So enter y/yes to add and n/Not for not.
then it will ask in Which file format you want to export the data. Available options are pdf and text.
then it will ask ask for file name. and then it will export the data in given file format.
